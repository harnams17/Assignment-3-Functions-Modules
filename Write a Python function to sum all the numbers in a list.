#Write a Python function to sum all the numbers in a list.

#Sample List : (8, 2, 3, 0, 7)

#Expected Output : 20

#Explanation:

#Summation should like 8+2+3+0+7 = 20

#Python Code:

def sum(n):
    total = 0
    for x in n:
        total += x
    return total
print("Summation (8, 2, 3, 0, 7) = ", sum((8, 2, 3, 0, 7)))

#Output: 
Summation (8, 2, 3, 0, 7) =  20
